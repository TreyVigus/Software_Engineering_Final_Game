---  The Story of Ichabod  ---


I am Ichabod the undead soldier.  I do not travel in search of fame or 
riches, but I must avenge my death and find my true brother the 
only other one that the Strogg didn’t get to.  But I am getting ahead 
of myself, you do not understand yet.   

I was a Marine in the Great War.  One evening, I was sent to deliver a 
message to a nearby encampment of marines.  When I returned the 
next morning, I was captured by my own platoon.  I was tortured and 
probed for information for two days before I finally gave up the well, 
you understand.

While I was away, my platoon had been captured and brainwashed by 
the Strogg.  They were reprogrammed and turned loose to capture 
and give the treatment to any of their former allies.  Only one other 
marine from my platoon escaped this fate.  I do not know where he 
was that night I only know that he was not captured by the Strogg.  
Now, I seek him out, so that together, we may avenge the fate of our 
platoon and my death.

My chosen name means, the glory has left this place. Ah, yes, the glory 
has left, but not the mind, the hate, and the thirst for revenge!


--- What Ichabod is ---

Ichabod is my first attempt at a model, and a fun experience for me.  I tried to create 
a model that would be both original and fit comfortably in the Quake2 environment.  As far
as I can tell, no one else has created a skeleton model, and It was important to me to 
have a one of a kind model.  Yes, I have seen skeleton skins, but those suck! I mean,
ribs drawn on the default model make it look like a halloween costume,  that's not cool!
now you can see through the chest!  I did not want it to be "anotomically correct" as can be
seen in the enlargement of the jaw and angle of the brow, and other misc. things like # of 
ribs and such.  I designed it to be a stylized version of a skeleton, with a few  
exaggerations as I felt necessary.  Call it campy, but I like a mix of cool and fun, and I 
can't be ALL serious.  Hope you enjoy it!  Let me know if you like the model, and feel free
to make your own skins too...


--- Notes on Ichabod ---

I have given Ichabod full VWep support, for your fragging enjoyment!  (I cant live without it now...)
Ctf skins included - these are just color variants of the base skin...
Custom sounds

If you have problems, make sure there are ONLY model folders in the player dir.  and make sure you 
unzipped these files into a folder called Ichabod.

--- Discalimer ---

Ichabod is free to do with as you please, as long as it remains free. Let me know if you like 
it or use it.  This charachter is entirely original, and is not based, nor is any similarity
intended, to any existing charachter or model.
